                    <section>
                            <h3 class="font-bold">How long does a program take?</h3>
                            <p>A traditional program takes place over a twelve month period, although treatment length may vary. There are three phases to therapy: the intensive phase, the habituation phase, the maintenance phase. Initially, visits are held weekly but move to monthly intervals as therapy progresses. For success in this therapy, consistent exercise every day is necessary until the patient has corrected their improper muscle pattern. It also requires commitment by the patient, family, and time. It is possible that your myofunctional therapy journey will include referrals to other professionals such as dentists, doctors, orthodontists, ENTs, sleep specialists, and osteopaths. These factors may change the length of your program, however, a holistic approach is essential for successful treatment. Often, one of these professionals will refer you for myofunctional therapy. If a thumb or finger sucking habit is present, it must be addressed and eliminated before treatment can commence. A habit elimination program can vary but might take up to thirty days.</p>
    
                            <h3 class="font-bold mt-8">What does myofunctional therapy treatment look like?</h3>
                            <p class="">You will be given a therapy kit at the beginning of your program. Each visit you will receive a list of exercises to perform, some of which might include items from your kit, though many do not require extra materials. You are expected to complete exercises two times a day, with three times a day being encouraged. Orofacial myofunctional therapy is painless, and the exercises are relatively simple.</p>
                        
                            <h3 class="font-bold mt-8">Should myofunctional therapy occur before or after orthodontic treatment?</h3>
                            <p>Orthodontic and Orofacial Myofunctional Therapy are closely related, with each directly impacting the other. Each case must be analyzed and discussed by the professionals involved. Treatment might be indicated before, during, or after orthodontics. Specialists in Orofacial Myofunctional Therapy promote muscle and orofacial function balance, improving tongue posture and thus aiding in maintaining orthodontic stability, helping to diminish orthodontic relapse after braces are removed.</p>

                            <h3 class="font-bold mt-8">What ages do you treat?</h3>
                            <p>Myofunctional therapy is suitable for everyone from age 4 upwards, but treatment around the age of 7 or 8 is ideal as oral habits are less ingrained and easier to change, which can encourage normal dental growth. Motivation and commitment are key to success.</p>

                            <h3 class="font-bold mt-8">Do you take insurance?</h3>
                            <p>Upon request, a superbill will be provided for you to submit to your insurance company.</p>

                            <h3 class="font-bold mt-8">Do you offer telehealth?</h3>
                            <p>Yes. You have the option of being treated in person or via video conferencing. You can also opt for a combination of both if preferred.</p>
                        <h1 class="font-bold mt-8">What research is available?</h1>
                        <p>Myofunctional Therapy is a relatively new field that is gaining recognition in the medical community. Research studies support the effectiveness of this discipline. Listed below are results of studies which show the significant impact of myofunctional therapy treatment.</p>

                    <p>Orofacial Myofunctional Therapy (OMT), more commonly referred to as myofunctional therapy, is related to the study, research, prevention, evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of functional and structural alterations in the region of the mouth (oro), face (facial), and regions of the neck (oropharyngeal area). The purpose of therapy is to assist the normalization of the developing, or developed, craniofacial structures and function through neurological re-education exercises.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>OMT treats Orofacial Myofunctional Disorders (OMDs), which are disorders of the muscles and functions of the face and mouth. An OMD is a pathological condition created by disruption in the functions of the stomatognathic system, primarily functions related to chewing, breathing, and swallowing. OMDs may affect, directly and/or indirectly: sleep apnea, facial skeletal growth and development, breathing, chewing, swallowing, speech, occlusion, posture, temporomandibular joint movement, oral hygiene, stability of orthodontic treatment, facial esthetics, restricted facial and lingual frenum, forward head posture, incorrect oral habits and more.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>There are 32 identified Orofacial Myofunctional Disorders. Click on each condition to learn more about the orofacial myofunctional disorder, how orofacial myofunctional therapy helps, as well as pictures of what can happen if left untreated.</p>

In this way of breathing, the individual does not use, or uses very little, the nose to inhale and exhale the air.  The person may have one or more of the following characteristics: nasal congestion, open mouth at rest; parched lips, lip color change, appearance of a large tongue that may be recessed and projected forward; long face syndrome; forward head posture; dark circles under the eyes, sagging cheeks, wheezing, and snoring. In such cases it is recommended that an otolaryngologist (ENT) and/or allergist be consulted.  The most common causes of mouth breathing are: allergic rhinitis, sinusitis, bronchitis, enlarged adenoids; enlarged tonsils; weakness or low tone of facial muscles that may lead to open mouth rest posture, habits such as thumb sucking, tumors in the region of the nose, enlarged turbinates, and nose fractures, amongst others.  Mouth breathing can cause damage in several aspects, such as the mouth’s and face’s structures and their function, including sleep, feeding, learning, hearing and speech.' },

                                // { id: 1, title: 'How can mouth breathing affect functions related to the mouth and face?', content: 'Mouth breathing leads to chewing food with lips apart, which becomes faster, noisier and less efficient than with lips closed. This can lead to greater digestive problems and potential for choking due to the poor coordination between breathing, chewing, and an increase in the swallowing of air. It’s hard to breathe through the mouth when the mouth is full, thus an individual will need to choose whether to chew or to breathe. In the process of swallowing, one may also notice changes such as: anterior projection of the tongue, noise, contraction of muscles that wrap around the mouth and movements of the head. There may also be excessive production of saliva and an anterior lisp: which is a distortion of speech characterized by placing the tongue between the front teeth during sound production of /s/ and /z/.' },

                                // { id: 1, title: 'What are disadvantages that mouth breathing may contribute with regards to feeding and body weight?', content: 'Mouth breathers may have poor appetite, lower strength for chewing and swallowing difficulties. Thus they may prefer softer foods and the use of liquid to assist feeding. The feeding of mouth breathers may also be impaired because of decreased olfaction (smell) and taste (taste). As a result of changes in chewing, smell, and taste, the individual may have decreased appetite, gastric changes, constant thirst, gagging, pallor, anorexia, and weight loss with less physical improving or, conversely, obesity.' },

Ear infection may lead to hearing loss, speech problems, language delays and vestibular issues. It is important to pay close attention to children in such cases: listen well to determine if they have difficulty hearing in the presence of noise; if they are unable to answer questions or follow direction, or could be considered inattentive. Most common changes are hoarseness in voice. This is because of the constantly open mouth leading to a drying out of all the structures that produce the voice and because the muscles are contracted for a long time, they may also appear to frequently have a cold and a runny nose.' },

Sleep apnea is a potentially serious sleep disorder in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts. You may have sleep apnea if you snore loudly and you feel tired even after a full night’s sleep.
